# Work Sample proposal

This is my proposed solution for the work sample for Perspective.io's recruiting process, with the goal of building a funnel preview tool for web platforms.

More details of the work sample on this [notion page](https://perspectiveco.notion.site/Work-Sample-Senior-Frontend-Engineer-Andr-s-Felipe-Osorio-1ee56ab4ce7547e2bc4e136a99b152d6).

## Acceptance criteria

### functional

- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to:
  - [ ] Upload a funnel JSON file from local computer and generate a mobile preview of the funnel.
  - [ ] I want to navigate between the different funnel pages by
    - [ ] an external navigation
  - [ ] select another funnel JSON file without having to reload the page.

### Non-functional

- [ ] Use Typescript as the programming language
- [ ] Use React or NextJS as the base framework
- [ ] Run smoothly on any desktop browser
- [ ] Run smoothly on mobile browsers (optional)
- [ ] Only the following blocks are supported
  - [ ] Text
  - [ ] Image
  - [ ] Button
  - [ ] List
- [ ] Block design does not have any system or tokens, so it's free to design them
